socket.sendall
 is a high-level Python-only method that sends the entire buffer you pass or throws an exception. It does that by calling socket.send until everything has been sent or an error occurs.
If you're using TCP with blocking sockets and don't want to be bothered by internals (this is the case for most simple network applications), use sendall.

message.encode
data send through bytes. so encode the string message to bytes send to server. Server send response in bytes and then client decode to string message

global 
set global variable to be used in anywhere in the code

stop flag
variable to use in order to stop the infinite loop

thread.join
need to join thread before closing server socket, if not the other thread will raise an exception
